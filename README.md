## My Professional Portfolio. Currently a work in progress that will continually be updated!

My goal in this refactor:
- Create a portfolio that is responsive, elegant, and easy to navigate!

Execution:
- The hardest part of this was getting the text and images to be responsive how I needed them to be.
- Currently in the process of implementing SASS to have responsive font sizes.
- I am proud of it's current state. There is obviously still work to be done on the responsive font sizes and the overall prettiness of the site, but it's fully functional and responsive.
- All of my links work, however all of my material is hosted on an external Squarespace website I'm not proud of so that's why my portfolio doesn't link over there.

Features:
- Sleek navbar with a gradient
- Sticky Footer with copyright
- Multiple sub-rows and sub-columns on every page
- Fixed, responsive background images

Noteworthy:
- The use of a .debug class that gave my elements a border really helped me find where my sizing and vertical alignment issues were.
- There was an issue with the footer where a small pixel-wide gap would appear under it sometimes. This was fixed by adding `bottom: -1px` to the footer class.
- I utilized Font-Awesome to create the logo in the left-most side of the Navbar.
- Found out that gifs are easily implemented in img tags.
