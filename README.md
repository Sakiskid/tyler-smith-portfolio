# tyler-smith-portfolio

My goal in this refactor:
- Create a portfolio that is responsive, elegant, and easy to navigate!

Execution:
- The hardest part of this was getting the text and images to be responsive how I needed them to be.
- 

Noteworthy:
- The use of a .debug class that gave my elements a border really helped me find where my sizing and vertical alignment issues were.
- There was an issue with the footer where a small pixel-wide gap would appear under it sometimes. This was fixed by adding `bottom: -1px` to the footer class.
