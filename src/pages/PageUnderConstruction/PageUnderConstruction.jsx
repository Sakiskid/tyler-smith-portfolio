                My name is Tyler Smith. I am a former C# Game Developer that turned to Full Stack development after one too many game jams. My portfolio will be up soon, I just have been busy working on <a href="www.ELTConstructionTX.com" target="_blank">client websites</a> as well as starting a new job.
